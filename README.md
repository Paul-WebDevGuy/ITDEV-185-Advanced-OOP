# ITDEV-185-Advanced-OOP
This course focused on Object Oriented Programming while using the language C++.  Emphasis is on algorithms, data structure and software engineering. Topics include header files, pointer data types, encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance and polymorphism as well as introduction to design patterns.

ASSIGNMENT 1-  This assignment had us design a program that would take in a date (month/year) and any amount of money.  The amount would be how much a business brought in in a month total.  The code would then take that money and calcuate various tax amounts and output several things such as county tax collected, sales tax collected, total tax etc.
The objective was for us to familiarize ourselves with formatting output in C++ and how to handle input and output data.
